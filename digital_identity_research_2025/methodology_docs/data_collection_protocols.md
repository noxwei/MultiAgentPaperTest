# Data Collection Protocols for Digital Identity Research
## Ethical and Methodological Guidelines (2020-2025)

### Overview
This document establishes comprehensive protocols for collecting primary data on digital identity formation and community building using free-tier APIs and publicly available datasets. All protocols prioritize ethical research practices, privacy protection, and methodological rigor while working within resource constraints.

---

## ETHICAL FRAMEWORK

### Core Ethical Principles
1. **Privacy Protection**: All data must be public, anonymized, and used within platform terms of service
2. **Informed Consent**: When possible, inform communities about research purposes
3. **Cultural Sensitivity**: Respect community norms and avoid extractive research practices
4. **Academic Integrity**: Transparent methodology and limitation acknowledgment
5. **Minimal Harm**: Research should not disrupt or harm online communities

### IRB Considerations
- **Exempt Research**: Focus on publicly available data reduces IRB requirements
- **Community Benefit**: Research should benefit understanding of digital communities
- **Transparency**: Clear documentation of data collection and analysis methods
- **Anonymization**: All examples must protect individual privacy
