# Autonomous Humanities Research Project: The Evolution of Digital Identity and Community Formation in Social Media (2020-2025)

## Project Overview

Conduct a comprehensive interdisciplinary humanities research project examining how digital identity formation and online community building have evolved during the post-pandemic era (2020-2025). This research should synthesize perspectives from sociology, anthropology, psychology, media studies, and digital humanities to create a scholarly analysis of contemporary digital culture.

## Core Research Questions

1. How has the concept of “authentic self” evolved in digital spaces since 2020?
1. What new forms of community formation have emerged through social media platforms?
1. How do different demographic groups construct and maintain digital identities?
1. What role has the pandemic played in accelerating digital-first social relationships?
1. How do platform algorithms influence identity performance and community dynamics?
