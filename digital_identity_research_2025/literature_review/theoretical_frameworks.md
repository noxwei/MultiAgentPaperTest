- **Temporal Dynamics**: Time-sensitive content and ephemeral communication
- **Cross-Platform Identity Management**: Maintaining coherent identity across multiple platforms

**Contemporary Relevance:**
Critical for understanding how pandemic-era digital migration created new challenges for identity management across persistent, searchable, and scalable digital environments.

#### C. Authentic Self in Digital Spaces Framework
**Theoretical Development (2020-2025):**
- **Curated Authenticity**: Strategic presentation of genuine self-aspects
- **Algorithmic Authenticity**: Identity performance shaped by platform algorithm expectations

2. **Audience Management**: Navigating multiple audiences in collapsed contexts
3. **Feedback Integration**: Incorporating social feedback into identity development
4. **Platform Affordances**: How platform features enable/constrain authentic expression

### 2. Community Formation Theory

#### A. Social Capital Theory (Digital Communities)
**Classical Framework (Putnam, Coleman):**

**Core Mechanisms:**
- **Personalized Curation**: Algorithms shape identity through content exposure
- **Feedback Loops**: User engagement influences future algorithmic recommendations
- **Identity Categories**: Algorithms sort users into demographic/interest categories
- **Behavioral Modification**: Identity performance adapted to algorithmic expectations

**Platform Algorithm Differences:**
- **Engagement-Based** (Facebook, Instagram): Prioritize interaction and relationship maintenance
- **Interest-Based** (TikTok, YouTube): Focus on content consumption and discovery
- **Chronological** (Twitter/X): Time-based content organization
- **Community-Based** (Reddit): Democratic/voting-based content curation

#### B. Perceived Algorithm Responsiveness (PAR) Theory
**Key Concepts (Taylor & Choi, 2022):**
- **Algorithm Awareness**: User understanding of algorithmic mediation
- **Perceived Responsiveness**: Belief that algorithms adapt to user preferences
- **Algorithm Insensitivity**: Perception that algorithms ignore user needs
- **Platform Differences**: Varying PAR across different social media platforms

**Research Findings:**
- TikTok users report higher PAR than Facebook/Instagram users
- Algorithm awareness weakly correlates with actual algorithm responsiveness
- PAR significantly predicts user enjoyment and engagement

#### C. Algorithmic Community Formation Theory
**Mechanisms:**
- **Interest-Based Clustering**: Algorithms group users by similar content engagement
- **Echo Chamber Formation**: Reinforcement of existing preferences and beliefs
- **Filter Bubble Effects**: Limited exposure to diverse perspectives
- **Serendipitous Discovery**: Unexpected content leading to new community formation

**Community Types:**
1. **Algorithm-Native Communities**: Formed primarily through algorithmic suggestion
2. **Hybrid Communities**: Combination of algorithmic and organic formation
3. **Algorithm-Resistant Communities**: Intentionally working against algorithmic curation
4. **Cross-Platform Communities**: Using multiple algorithms for different community functions

### 4. Crisis Communication and Community Resilience Theory
